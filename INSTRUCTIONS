Create a simple web site with the following characteristics:


Login page that takes a user name and password.
Main page that goes to three other pages.
The three other pages should have a links back to the main page.
All three pages should have separate forms that fill in tables on the same page with info from the form.  Store tables entries in in server variables.

Then try the following in three windows:
nodemon app.js
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar
